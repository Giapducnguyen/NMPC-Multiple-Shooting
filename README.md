# NMPC-Multiple-Shooting
Simulation files on basic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with control rate, soft constraints, and control horizon, coded in Casadi, MATLAB.

The source files can be found at:

(Thank you so much for the study materials, Mr Mohamed W. Mehrez!)

Modifications made to the above reference:
1 - Adding control rate constraints and soft constraints on control rates.
2 - Adding the control horizon, which can differ from the prediction horizon.
